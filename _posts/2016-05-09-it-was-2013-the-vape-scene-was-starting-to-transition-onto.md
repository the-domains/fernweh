It was 2013\. The vape scene was starting to transition onto social media platforms from the forum worlds starting with the great Facebook migration of 2013\. Vape shops were few and far between and group buys were outrageously popular. The thing about group buys was that they only existed for items produced in China. The concept of group buys for authentic products was nonexistent, let alone high end items. In fact liquid manufacturers did not offer their liquids through group buys. 

Near the end of the year two men met in the depths of the Facebook Vape scene. Dan Brown and Ken Rivera. Dan had a vision and was determined to find a way to bring authentic items to the people at group buy pricing. Ken understood the logistics of making it happen with the work ethic to lead the charge. Together they (with a handful of friends knowns as the "Nguyens") built one of the fastest growing and biggest groups on Facebook for buying, selling, and trading vape gear, VTGB. Mostly disbanded today, VTGB was home to the birth of authentic group buys and liquid group buys. Some of the biggest names in vaping today once called VTGB home. 

While VTGB itself has mostly fallen to the wayside, Ken and Dan continue to run group buys for the biggest players in the game in the most respected and exclusive markets of the high end world. None have been able to surpass their ability to consistently bring high quality to the masses at under retail prices. Their reputation for consistent quality and follow-through has been well cemented in the community. But as time has passed their vision has grown. What was once a hobby had becoming something much more as they set their eyes to mod making. The two had acquired enough knowledge from watching the industry grow to be confident that they would be able to make it happen. 

Enter Gem Dyllinger and Erick Dy. The 4 men were already acquainted on different levels from previous dealings. Gem and Erick had developed a reputation for designing and manufacturing quality products under the banner of Rai Vapes and a separate side project known as Lucille. Lucille was easily among the top of the list in terms of quality mechanical mods and would undoubtedly have been of the most sought after were it not for the migration to regulated devices. Gem understood design, Erick understood manufacturing, Ken had a commanding knowledge of market trends, Dan could paint the vision conceptually, and all knew what it truly meant to create something high quality. 

January 2015 the Fernweh was born. Gem sketched out a design on a napkin and sent it to Dan. Dan shared that picture with Ken and they knew that with the experience of Gem and Erick their dream of making a mod could become a reality. Over the next several months prototypes were produced and tested, adjustments were made, Mark Makko was brought on board to provide the highest quality wiring, and the Fernweh now lives.
